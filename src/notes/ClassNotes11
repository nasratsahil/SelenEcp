Class 11

Upload Documents:
In order to upload documents using Selenium we can simply do sendKeys(filePath)

If sendKeys does not work, you can use Robot class

JS executor
It is a library in selenium which can be executed in different programming languages
(java, c#, python etc)

JSExecutor is an Interface

We should only be using JSexecutor when we are not able to perform actions such as:
Click on elements
scroll the page
refresh the page
highlight an element
scroll to a specific element
open a new tab

What is POM?
POM is a design pattern which helps us to enhance our test maintenance and reduce code duplication

POM can be implemented in 2 ways:
1. POM without PageFactory
2. POM with PageFactory

PageFactory is a class which gives us an opportunity to interact with elements stored in each page class

IQ:
How do you switch to a new tab in selenium?
We use getWindowHandles to switch between tabs and windows
