Alerts:
Alert is pop up message. Alert takes complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
We cannot proceed until it is handled.

3 types of alerts:
1. web based alerts / html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. Javascript alerts / browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo() method
                                        we cannot inspect
3. windows based alerts - we cannot handle with selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1. simple alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter text and then click ok

To handle JS alert we only have 4 methods:
1. accept();
2. dismiss();
3. getText();
4. sendKeys();

Interview Question:
How do you handle an alert in selenium?
We handle alerts by using Alert interface
